Welcome to my homepage. I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.uth.gr/) of the [University of Thessaly](http://www.uth.gr/). Here, you will find links to my [publications](/al-folio/publications/), information about my [research activities](/ai-folio/research), information and links relevant to my [teaching duties](/al-folio/teaching/), and look at my [cv](/al-folio/cv/).

Last but not least, you may want to check at the [Greek Algebra and Number Theory Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/gantseminar) that I co-organize.
