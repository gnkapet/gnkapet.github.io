Welcome to my homepage. I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.uth.gr/) of the [University of Thessaly](http://www.uth.gr/). Here, you will find links to my [publications](/al-folio/publications/), information about my [research activities](/ai-folio/research), information and links relevant to my [teaching duties](/al-folio/teaching/), and look at my [cv](/al-folio/cv/).

Last but not least, you may want to check at the [Greek Algebra and Number Theory Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/gantseminar) that I co-organize.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
